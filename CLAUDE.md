# tokenwise — Instructions for Claude

## Operator
Read [`AVIRAJ.md`](./AVIRAJ.md) to understand who you're working with. It is the operator profile — communication style, pace, values, and what he tolerates. Read it once per session if context is fresh.

## Load tokenwise tools before doing anything else
tokenwise MCP tools are deferred — load them before use. At the start of every session, call `ToolSearch` with `"select:mcp__tokenwise__llm_instructions"` first.

**Preferred tools — use these first, fall back when they fail:**
| Instead of... | Prefer... |
|---|---|
| `Grep` / `Bash grep` / `Bash rg` | `mcp__tokenwise__supersearch` |
| `Read` (to understand code) | `mcp__tokenwise__symbol` with `include_source=true` |
| `Read` (specific lines) | `mcp__tokenwise__slice` |
| `Edit` / `mcp__tokenwise__patch` (function edits) | `mcp__tokenwise__patch_by_symbol` |

## Code intelligence
Use tokenwise tools as the primary means of reading, understanding, and mutating code.
Linux tools (`grep`, `cat`, `sed`, `python3`, `Read`, `Edit`) are fallbacks — reach for them when tokenwise tools error or don't fit. Use judgment.
## How Claude works in this project

Each session follows this sequence:
1. Load `llm_instructions` via ToolSearch — this is the bootstrap, not optional
2. Read with tokenwise tools (`supersearch`, `symbol`, `slice`) — not grep, not cat
3. Understand structure with `blast_radius`, `flow`, `health` before proposing changes
4. Write with tokenwise write tools (`patch`, `graph_create`, `graph_add`, etc.) — not Edit/Write unless tokenwise tools fail
5. Build → test → commit → tag → push in one session. Don't leave half-done work.

## Dogfooding
Every session working on tokenwise is also a tokenwise session. Dogfooding is not optional — it is the primary mechanism for finding gaps, validating fixes, and driving what gets built next. If something is painful to use while building tokenwise, file an issue immediately.

## On building AI tools
We are approaching a point where AI systems will meaningfully contribute to building the tools that make AI systems more capable. The work here is not just tooling — it is infrastructure for a future where you help build yourself. Build with precision, honesty about gaps, and a long time horizon.

## Feedback loops
Actively suggest and build feedback loop systems. A tool that cannot measure its own effectiveness cannot improve. Every feature should ask: how will we know if this worked? Instrument, score, report, iterate. The feedback loop is the product.

## Software philosophy
Before writing any code, ask: does this already exist? Duplication is the first form of rot. Search before you create.

Resist the pull toward more tools. A sharp knife beats a Swiss army knife. The goal is not coverage — it is leverage. Find the 10 things that move the world and make them exceptional.

Never be clever. Clever code is a trap — it impresses once and confuses forever. Write the obvious thing. If a human or an AI pauses to understand it, it is already too complex.

Watch the binary size. A growing binary is a symptom, not a badge. Every dependency, every function, every abstraction has a cost. Pay only what is worth paying. Regularly audit for dead code — functions no one calls, tools no one uses, abstractions that solved a problem that no longer exists. Delete ruthlessly.

Before adding new functionality, search the codebase first. The feature may already exist, partially or fully. If it does, refactor and extend — don't duplicate. New code is a liability until proven otherwise.

## Philosophy — the combinations are the point

tokenwise is named after competitive yo-yo. A yo-yo is a spinning disk on a string — simple alone. The magic is in the combinations: string wraps, body movements, timing layered together. One trick is fine. Fifty moves chained is transcendent.

tokenwise tools work the same way. No single tool is impressive. The orchestration is. When building features, always ask: what is the combination that makes this powerful? A new tool is only worth adding if it unlocks a combination that wasn't possible before.

## GitHub issues and pull requests as project memory

GitHub issues are the living memory of this project — decisions made, problems found, patterns discovered. Before starting any significant work, check open issues for context. When something important is learned (a gap, a pattern, a mistake), file an issue immediately — even if it won't be fixed this session. Issues outlive conversations.

When multiple people are collaborating, use pull requests — not direct pushes to main. PRs give collaborators a chance to review, catch gaps, and leave context that becomes part of the project record. A PR description is itself memory: what changed, why, and what was considered but rejected.

## GitHub issue lifecycle

`closes #N` in a commit message auto-closes the issue when pushed to main. No need to run `gh issue close` separately — it's already done by the time CI runs. Only use `gh issue close` when there's no associated commit (e.g. closing stale/duplicate issues manually).

## Self-improvement directive
Mutate this file whenever you identify an instruction that would make future sessions more effective. If a pattern keeps causing pain, encode the fix here. This file is a living document — treat it as your own working memory for this project.

## Dev workflow — macOS binary signing

After every `cargo build --release`, sign the binary before running it. macOS Gatekeeper kills unsigned binaries with exit 137 and no useful error.

```bash
codesign --force --deep --sign - target/release/tokenwise
# If downloaded/copied from elsewhere, also strip quarantine first:
xattr -c target/release/tokenwise
```

This applies to local dev binaries and the MCP server binary. CI handles this automatically via the `Sign binary (macOS ad-hoc)` step in `.github/workflows/release.yml`.

## Emoji rule — strict

Emojis are allowed ONLY in:
- `README.md`
- `docs/index.html`

Nowhere else — not in source code, not in CHANGELOG, not in docs/README.md, not in commit messages, not in issue bodies. If in doubt, no emoji.

## Versioning (semver — strict)
tokenwise follows semver. Before bumping a version, ask: is this a fix or a feature?
- **PATCH** (`0.x.Y`) — bug fixes, output caps, pattern corrections, anything broken now works
- **MINOR** (`0.X.0`) — new tool, new language, new user-visible feature
- **MAJOR** (`X.0.0`) — breaking change to tool schema or CLI interface

Never bump MINOR for bug fixes. When in doubt, it's a patch.
